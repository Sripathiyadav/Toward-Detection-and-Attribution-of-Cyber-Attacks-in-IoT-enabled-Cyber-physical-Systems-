# 🔐 Toward Detection and Attribution of Cyber Attacks in IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems

This project implements models and methods for detecting and attributing cyber attacks in IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).  
It includes datasets, training/testing scripts, and documentation to reproduce experiments and evaluate system performance.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and folders:

- **`datasets/`** – raw and pre-processed datasets used for training and testing.  
- **`datasetslink.txt`** – link to download the datasets if not included.  
- **`model/`** – ML/DL models for cyber attack detection and attribution.  
- **`main.py`** – entry point for running the training and evaluation pipeline.  
- **`test.py`** – script for testing the trained model on test datasets.  
- **`run.bat`** – batch file for running the project (Windows).  
- **`screens.docx`** – screenshots and documentation of the project.
